# ElevenLabs Documentation Overview
## Introduction

ElevenLabs is an AI audio research and deployment company providing state-of-the-art voice synthesis, voice transformation, and conversational AI technologies. This overview combines key information from across the documentation to provide a complete picture of ElevenLabs' capabilities and how to use them.

## Core Capabilities

### Text to Speech

ElevenLabs Text to Speech (TTS) technology converts written text into lifelike spoken audio with nuanced intonation, pacing, and emotional awareness. The TTS API supports:

- 32+ languages with natural-sounding pronunciation
- Thousands of voice options through various creation methods
- Emotional context interpretation from text cues
- Multiple audio formats and quality levels

**Key features:**
- High-quality audio synthesis with the Multilingual v2 model
- Ultra-low latency (75ms) with the Flash v2.5 model 
- Various output formats including MP3, PCM, and Î¼-law
- Customizable voice parameters for stability and similarity

### Voice Options

ElevenLabs provides multiple ways to access and create voices:

- **Voice Library**: 3,000+ community-shared voices across multiple languages
- **Professional Voice Cloning**: Highest-fidelity voice replicas for professional use
- **Instant Voice Cloning**: Quick voice replication from short audio samples
- **Voice Design**: Generate custom voices from text descriptions

Voice settings like stability and similarity allow for fine-tuning voice characteristics.

### Voice Changer

The Voice Changer technology transforms audio from one voice to another while preserving the original intonation, emotion, and pacing. This enables:

- Voice transformation while maintaining the original delivery
- Language translation with preserved emotional nuances
- Voice style transfer across different speakers

### Dubbing

The Dubbing capability translates and synchronizes audio/video content into different languages while preserving the original speaker's style and emotion. Features include:

- Automated translation and voice synthesis
- Preservation of original voice characteristics
- Support for multiple target languages
- Both audio and video dubbing options

### Sound Effects

The Sound Effects API generates realistic sound effects from text descriptions, allowing creators to:

- Create cinematic audio effects from simple text prompts
- Generate background sounds for various media productions
- Produce atmospheric and environmental audio

### Voice Isolator

The Voice Isolator tool removes background noise from audio recordings, enabling:

- Clean voice extraction from noisy environments
- Improved audio quality for voice processing
- Better input quality for voice cloning and other applications

### Conversational AI

ElevenLabs' Conversational AI platform combines natural language understanding with voice technology to create interactive voice agents that can:

- Engage in natural, human-like conversations
- Process and respond to user queries in real time
- Integrate with existing knowledge bases and systems
- Deploy across various applications and channels
